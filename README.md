# Loan Approval Prediction

This is a simple machine learning project built with **Scikit-learn** and **Pandas**.

The model is trained to decide whether a customer should be approved for a loan, needs to talk to a bank agent, or be denied — based on their income and debt level.

## 🔍 What it does

- Loads and prepares sample customer data
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
- Predicts loan approval status for a new customer
- Prints whether the loan is approved, denied, or requires manual review

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python loan_prediction_project_en.py
```

## 📂 File

- `loan_prediction_project_en.py` — Main code file for training and prediction.
